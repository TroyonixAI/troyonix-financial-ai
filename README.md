## üöÄ What We're Open-Sourcing

This repository contains the foundational layers of the Troyonix AI platform. We are open-sourcing our core data processing and model training pipeline to promote transparency and build a community around legally-sound financial AI.

### Key Features:
-   **Legal-Compliant Data Pipeline**: A production-ready data collection system that uses only public-domain sources like SEC EDGAR and Federal Reserve (FRED) data, eliminating legal risks associated with other financial data sources.
-   **Wealth Management Specialization**: Advanced preprocessing tailored for wealth management use cases and a fine-tuned FinBERT model that understands the nuances of financial sentiment.
-   **Full Transparency Framework**: Complete documentation on data lineage, processing steps, and legal considerations, ensuring every step is auditable and trustworthy.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The diagram below illustrates the flow of data from collection to training.

```

## üõ°Ô∏è The Troyonix Legal-First Approach

In an industry where data privacy and compliance are paramount, Troyonix is built on a "legal-first" principle. Our pipeline uses only:
-   ‚úÖ **SEC EDGAR Filings**: Public domain data for corporate financial reporting.
-   ‚úÖ **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**: Authoritative U.S. government economic indicators.
-   ‚úÖ **Policy Uncertainty Indices**: Respected academic sources for market sentiment.

This approach ensures our models are built on a foundation of data that is ethical, transparent, and free from commercial licensing restrictions.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get the entire pipeline running in just a few commands.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/troyonix-legal-financial-ai.git
cd troyonix-legal-financial-ai

2. Set up your environment:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate (or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows)

3. Install dependencies:
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. (Optional) Configure your API keys for FRED:
    cp config/config.example.json config/config.json

5. Run the data pipeline:
    python src/data_collection/collect_all_data.py
    python src/preprocessing/prepare_training_data.py

6. Train the model:
    python src/training/train_finbert.py

7. Evaluate & run inference:
    python src/analysis/evaluate_model.py
    python src/analysis/run_inference_examples.py
