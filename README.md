# Troyonix


**AI for the future of finance.**

Troyonix is a fintech company for wealth management and financial analysis, built for transparency, innovation, and community-driven progress. We use only public-domain data (SEC EDGAR, FRED, and academic indices, etc.) so you can build, learn, and deploy with confidence.

## üöÄ What is Troyonix?
Troyonix provides:
- **A robust data pipeline** for collecting and processing financial data from public sources.
- **Custom preprocessing and training pipelines** for financial NLP, featuring a **fine-tuned FinBERT model** and **continually evolving** domain-specific language models tailored through ongoing research.

- **Full transparency**‚Äîevery step is documented and auditable.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
- **Data Collection:** SEC filings, FRED economic data, policy uncertainty indices
- **Preprocessing:** Clean, label, and prepare data for training
- **Model Training:** Fine-tune FinBERT for financial sentiment and event detection
- **Analysis & Inference:** Evaluate and use your models on real financial text

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Legal-First?
Most financial AI projects use questionable or proprietary data. Troyonix is different:
- 100% public-domain sources (no licensing headaches)
- Transparent, auditable pipeline
- Built for compliance from day one
