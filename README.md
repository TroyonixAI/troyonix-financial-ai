🚀 What We're Open-Sourcing
This repository contains the foundational layers of the Troyonix AI platform—core data processing, compliance-first pipelines, and model training tools.

Key Features:
- Legal-Compliant Data Pipeline: Collects only public-domain sources (SEC EDGAR, FRED).
- Wealth Management Specialization: Advanced preprocessing and a fine-tuned FinBERT model for financial sentiment.
- Full Transparency: Complete documentation on data lineage, processing, and legal considerations.

🏗️ Architecture (Mermaid Diagram)
Sources → Collection → Prep → Train Data → Model → Deploy

🛡️ The Troyonix Legal-First Approach
Only these sources are used:
- SEC EDGAR Filings: Public domain corporate financial data.
- Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED): Official US economic indicators.
- Policy Uncertainty Indices: Academic, open-access sentiment measures.
Compliance is enforced in code—see src/data_collection for implementation details.

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites: Python 3.8+ and pip.

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/TroyonixAI/troyonix-financial-ai.git
    cd troyonix-financial-ai

2. Set up your environment:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate (or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows)

3. Install dependencies:
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. (Optional) Configure your API keys for FRED:
    cp config/config.example.json config/config.json

5. Run the data pipeline:
    python src/data_collection/collect_all_data.py
    python src/preprocessing/prepare_training_data.py

6. Train the model:
    python src/training/train_finbert.py

7. Evaluate & run inference:
    python src/analysis/evaluate_model.py
    python src/analysis/run_inference_examples.py
